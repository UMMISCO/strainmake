Everything to test the workflow.

## Preparing the data

The sequencing data are downloaded and subsampled using the [`prepare.sh`](prepare.sh)
script.

The data used are paired-end metagenomic sequences from a sediment sample 
(marine metagenome). It is the [ERR1855257](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1855257) 
run. These are Illumina reads.
